# Machine-Learning- Optical-Interconnection-Network-Analysis
This project aims to analysis of “Optical Interconnection Network”. That will predicted the maximum Channel Utilization for the network depends on the features that given through multiple regression.

# This Repository contain 3 files in R.
- The first exercises file, has done with all Pre-processing for the the data. Which is done with check for missingness, distribution for target and features, normalize the distribution, variance across the features, categorical features , numeric features,  apply a KNN model without pre-applying feature engineering processes, and then reapply the KNN model with feature engineered. Last thing is compare between them.

- The second exercises file, According to the “Optical Interconnection Network” dataset,
1. Apply  logistic regression model, first without pre-applying feature engineering processes, then reapply  with feature engineered, and then thing is compare between them which is the best.
2. Apply a principal component regression model.
3. Apply a partial least squares regression model
4. Apply a regularized regression model.
5. Identify the most influential features for this model.

- The 3 exercises file:
1. Apply a MARS model with all features.
2. Apply a random forest model
3. Identify the most influential features for this model.
